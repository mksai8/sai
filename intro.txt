An Application Programming Interface or an API is a set of definitions and protocols through which applications communicate with each other. With API your application or service can use the functions provided by another application without needing to know how that other application is being implemented. APIs can also serve as an intermediary layer for data transfers between system applications, allowing businesses to open their application data and functionality to third-party developers, business partners, as well as internal departments within their organizations. 

For example, the weather application on your mobile phone is communicating with the news bureauâ€™s API to fetch you the latest news, without needing to know the internal working of the news bureau API or consider an app like Zomato which uses API to show the restaurant locations on Google Maps without needing to know how the location is determined internally.
